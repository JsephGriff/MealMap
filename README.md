# MealMap Prototype

This repository hosts the **prototype pages** for the MealMap project, created for a University of Washington entrepreneurship course.

## ðŸ¥— About MealMap

**MealMap** is a health-focused app designed specifically for **UW college students** looking to improve their physical well-being while balancing a busy academic schedule.

Unlike general-purpose health and fitness apps, **MealMap** provides students with tailored support by:

- Mapping **healthy dining options on campus**
- Highlighting **fitness opportunities** at UW facilities

## ðŸš§ Note

These pages represent a **mock prototype** of the app.  
They are intended for demonstration purposes only and do not reflect final functionality.
